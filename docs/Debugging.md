With the OSC section of the Action Menu open, you can click "OSC Debug" to open a screen which will float in front of you and visualize any incoming OSC. This can help ensure that VRChat is properly receiving OSC, and you can see the range and address of the incoming values.

Note that opening this screen will also turn on OSC, in case it's disabled through the menu.
