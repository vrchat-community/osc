# Tools and Projects for OSC Development and Use

## WARNING: USE THESE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
It is INHERENTLY DANGEROUS to run code that someone else has written. Most of the projects below are open-source so you can verify that they are safe to use. If possible, read through the code and compile it yourself instead of using compiled binaries (exe files, etc).

## Submissions
If you would like submit your own project for consideration, please post it to [Show and Tell](https://github.com/vrchat-community/osc/discussions/categories/show-and-tell). To be considered, your project should be documented, open-source, include a license, and the project page must not violate or suggest violations of [VRChat's TOS](https://hello.vrchat.com/legal), or link to any pages that do. We will update this list weekly, adding and removing projects.
